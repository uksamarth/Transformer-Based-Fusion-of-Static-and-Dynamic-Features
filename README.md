# Transformer Based Fusion of Static and Dynamic Features

## Problem Statement

This project focuses on developing a unified multimodal framework for Automatic Unit (AU) detection and Expression recognition using a Transformer-based approach. The goal is to effectively fuse static (images, text) and dynamic (audio) features to enhance the accuracy and robustness of facial expression analysis systems.

### Objectives

- Propose a unified Multimodal framework for AU detection and Expression recognition.
- Incorporate basic expressions, Action Units (AU), and Valence-Arousal (VA) features into the model.
  
### Context of the Study

Facial Expression Analysis is a critical area in computer vision and human-computer interaction, with applications ranging from emotion recognition systems to virtual agents and affective computing.

### Modalities

The project will utilize the following modalities for feature extraction and fusion:
- Images (static features)
- Text (such as transcripts or textual descriptions associated with the facial expressions)
- Audio (dynamic features)
